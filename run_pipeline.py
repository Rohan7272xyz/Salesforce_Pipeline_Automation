I'm here to help you process your Salesforce pipeline files.

WHAT I CAN DO:

1. Assist in Sheet Formatting Changes: If you tell me to "Change Format", I'll send you the current excel template to modify. When you're done, reply with "Here" and attach the updated template.

2. Process Files: Attach your pipeline Excel file and I'll organize/process it for you.

Ready to get started? Just reply to this email with what you'd like to do! All our conversations will stay in this email thread.
